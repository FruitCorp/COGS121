# Milestone 5

For this milestone we improved on how we display restaurants to the user on the recommendations and history page and implemented our search bar so users can find restaurants that they have visited.

## User Action 1
The user can click on either the "Show me more" or "Discover" button and add a restaurant to their history by clicking Like or hiding the restaurant by clicking Hide "X"

The user can find the restaurants they have liked in the history section 

![History](history shows added restauraunts)


## User Action 2
The user can search for a restaurants they have visited using the search bar, and the results autocomplete from Yelp data.

![Search and Autocomplete](https://github.com/ruan-andy/COGS121/blob/master/milestone5/uiaction2.png)

When clicking the search button, the result will show up in the UI and the user is able to either hide the restaurant or "Like" it and add it to their history
