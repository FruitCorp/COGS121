## Privacy

### Our app keeps track of the restaurants that the user has been to in order to provide better recommendations and statistics. This might be a concern for users who do not want to share this kind of information with us. Therefore, we will inform users that we will be keeping track of and collecting their restaurant history data in order to provide a better experience. We can have a FAQ page that informs the users that we are collecting and making use of their data.
