### Project Proposal
1. ## TFTI

TFTI is a A public calendar app that allows users to host their own events and see their friends' events. It will automatically sync with Facebook friend list and events. It sends a SMS notification whenever your friends post a new event.

2. ## Tinner

The app suggests restaurants based on proximity and preferences. It allow users to "check-in" at a restaurant to gather data on a user's eating preferences. We will also implement a Tinder-like swiping gesture to swipe through restaurants. In usrer profile, the user can see the statistics of types of food you go to often, and recommends similar and new choices.
