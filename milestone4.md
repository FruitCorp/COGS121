# Milestone 4

## UI Changes

### We changed the fonts to give the app a more professional vibe. 

## Privacy

### Our app keeps track of the restaurants that the user has been to in order to provide better recommendations. This might be a concern for users who do not want to share this kind of information with us. Therefore, we will inform users that we need to collect their restaurant history data in order to provide a better experience. We can have a FAQ page that informs the users that we are collecting their data.
