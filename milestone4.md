## UI Changes
### We changed the fonts to give the app a more professional vibe and made changes to the buttons look. We also added a numbered list in the histories tab and have the title on the top as well.

## Privacy

### Our app keeps track of the restaurants that the user has been to in order to provide better recommendations. This might be a concern for users who do not want to share this kind of information with us. Therefore, we will inform users that we need to collect their restaurant history data in order to provide a better experience. We can have a FAQ page that informs the users that we are collecting their data. We will not share the user's data with anybody since we are only collecting the data to provide them a better service and we will personally not look at the user data.
