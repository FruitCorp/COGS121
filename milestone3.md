# Milestone 3

### Our screenshots layout currently don't match our paper prototypes very much. This is because we are just laying things out with little planning. When we were working on our project the past week, we were more focused on having the frontend, backend, and connection rather than how it looked. That being said, the content is more or less the same as the paper prototype.
